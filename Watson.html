    <p>Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 â€“ June 19, 1956) was an American businessman who served as the chairman
        and CEO of IBM. He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson
        developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR. He turned
        the company into a highly effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines. A
        leading self-made industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's
        greatest salesman when he died in 1956.
        <br><br>
        Thomas J. Watson was born in Campbell, New York, the fifth child and only
        son of Thomas and Jane Fulton White Watson. His four older siblings were Jennie, Effie, Loua, and Emma. His father farmed and owned a modest
        lumber business located near Painted Post, a few miles west of Corning, in the Southern Tier region of New
        York. Thomas worked on the family farm in East Campbell, New York and attended the District School Number
        Five in the late 1870s. As Watson entered his teen years he attended Addison Academy In Addison, New York.
